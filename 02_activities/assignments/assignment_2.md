# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Your answer...
## Good visualization 
 United Nations' GII Human Development Report's own graphic, here: https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/thematic-composite-indices/gender-inequality-index#/indicies/GII
 - Clearly, accurately and persuasively uses complex, multidimensional United Nation's gender inequality index data to tell a story: On average, "the loss in potential human development due to inequality between female and male achievements" has become smaller world-wide, although large differences continue to exist among countries and global regions over time. This visualization is a good example of a substantive depiction of the underlying data (Slide 1, p. 25).
 - Interactive (e.g., can select and compare three countries, or select a region) interface that provides either line graphs showing overall index trend by country (for a general audience) and a pop-up box containing more detailed information (for a specialist audience), which is also aesthetically pleasing, having a clear colour gradient among country's line graphs.
 - Honest and potentially reproducible: link to downloadable dataset provided immediately beneath the data visualization, vetted by a large, internationally-recognized development organization

## Bad visualization
Gender Inequality Index by Kizley Benedict: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kizley.benedict
- I want to rate this data visualization as an example of a good visualization because something it attempts to do, which I appreciate: it attempts to simultaneously depict both specific (here, GII comparisons by country bubble size) and general (here, GII average regional vs. global average comparisons using a number line) comparisons. It also shows the countries by region areas on a series of global maps, with the respective countries colour-coded by their relative index grouping (i.e., very low to very high). 
- However there are numerous problems associated with this data visualization, some of which are:
	- Inconsistent use of circle shape representation, which is initially confusing: The circles variously refer to country (where bubble size compares country's relative GII measure and the circle colour represents regional group) or regional GII measures (where circle size is static but still represents regional group)
	- Inaccuracy: Alberto Cairo argues strenuously against the use of bubble charting as a way of comparing relative size differences, which I would suggest is a relevant human perceptual issue at play here. Cairo explains: "Bubbles are misleading. They make you underestimate differences," which would have the effect understating country GII differences (Cairo, Alberto. _The Functional Art: An Introduction to Information Graphics and Visualization_. New Riders, 2013, p. 39). 
	- Non-neutral presentation of regional GII differences, through the use of ranking (left-to-right, from worst to best regional averages) and the use of colour (from red for worst, indicating alarming inequity, for blue for best, perhaps indicating calmer, more competent gender equity conditions). Such a presentation could bias the audience to consider regional location as an  incontrovertible driver of country gender inequality, which would be a simplistic conclusion.

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
## Good visualization
Rhetorical choice: Although the visualization is factual, it also tells a story about countries relative GII measures over time — mainly that, on average, the GII has improved on a global scale between 1990 and 2023. However, the data filter is "by developing region," and does not include a developed region(s) category. By doing so, the UN could highlight the GII gap between developing and developed countries, while also showing any disparities in GII improvement among developed countries over the the same time period. Your answer...

## Bad visualization
Cognitive load/extraneous complexity: It is possible to reduce the amount of work this data visualization requires of its audience by more accurately depicting regional GII comparisons. Because the data visualization shows only a single year of data: (a) use a bar chart to compare regional average GIIs (and a horizontal line to show the 2022 global average), and (b) use a series of grid plots to depict the percentage of countries for each GII category (five categories, ranked from vey low to very high) by region, to better show how each region's GII score is decomposed by area and to compare regions on that basis.

      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
